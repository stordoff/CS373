This is a test environment for some of the algorithms discussed in the Udacity CS373 course. It is very much a work in progress.

"""

So far, we has histogram localisation implemented, and it seems to work OK.
There is no planning, or recognition of obstactles

Next:   Prove that localisation is working

        Kalman localisation (if possible in discrete world)
        Particle Filters
        A* and Dynamic Programming (obstactle recognition)

        Move away from colors and use wall range finding

        Smoothing (if possible in discrete world)
        PID Controller (ditto)

        Add continuous world for robot motion, but use discrete world as planning
            and localisation environment
        Landmarks in continuous space
